# Bot System Comments

## bot_move.cpp

### Bot_DecomposeMove
PM_WalkMove and PM_AirMove both flatten forward/right and renormalize before use, so whatever pitch and roll the engine puts in pmove->angles drops out and the basis is just the yaw.

### Bot_NormalizeAngle
Wraps an angle into (-180, 180]. Lives here rather than in bot_move_nav.cpp so both movement
translation units share one copy.

## bot_move_nav.cpp

### Constants
- kFullDrive: Over maxspeed on purpose: PM_CheckParamters rescales the forward/side pair down to maxspeed, so this just means "full speed in exactly the commanded direction".
- kAimVelocitySpeed: Below this the velocity carries no usable heading, so the aim holds where it is rather than snapping about on numerical noise.

### WriteTraceLog
Writes bot trajectory trace to file specified by crossbot_trace_path cvar (defaults to valve/crossbot_data/nav_trace.txt).

### Repath
Finds path from current area to goal area using A* and builds waypoint plan.
- Clamps goal point into goal area bounds.
- On fresh attempt, calculates total path distance and estimated arrival time.
- Logs waypoint details including jump/crouch flags and target area IDs.

Two different log lines, and the distinction matters when reading a failure. A fresh path logs
`Repath` plus every waypoint; a mid-route re-plan logs the one-line `Replan`, because that is the one
that fires after a failed air move and it would otherwise be silent. Both carry `penalized=`, the
count of connections on the chosen route with a nonzero `runtimePenalty` — so `penalized=0` on the
replan after a failure means the penalty did its job and the new route avoids the bad edge.

### Bot_MoveNav
Main navigation-driven movement function. Repath triggers are: empty path, forced (air move landed
off-target), and stall (no progress for kRepathInterval).

An air move or ladder that finishes in the wrong area replans in the *same* frame, not the next one.
The forced-repath latch is read at the top of the frame, above the air-move and ladder blocks, so a
landing that arms it would otherwise spend a frame driving on a plan the bot has provably left — and
`trackState.started` is cleared on that same frame, which makes the reprojection global and can snap
`progressS` anywhere on the stale profile. Both blocks therefore re-check the latch through
`TryRepath` once their runner returns.

- Uses NavFollow::Track against the `PlanProfile` built at repath time (see doc/nav.md). Progress is
  arclength along the arc chain, so there is no per-waypoint arrival radius or advance loop, and
  waypoint 0 is no longer a special case — the chain starts at the bot's own position.
- Drive magnitude is the servo's `wishSpeed`, divided by `kDuckingMultiplier` when `FL_DUCKING`
  (the engine applies 0.333 after the maxspeed clamp) and then clamped to maxspeed. This replaced the
  constant `kFullDrive = 1000`, which meant the bot had no speed control at all: it entered every
  corner at full speed and walked past the goal until an arrival radius caught it.
- Stall detection is rebased on `trackState.progressS` advancing, not on the waypoint index changing —
  a bot correctly braking to a stop at a hard node would otherwise read as stalled. At 2 s the timer is
  short enough that a maneuver which suspends `Track` has to hold the clock open itself: `RunLadderMove`
  and `RunAirmoveFlight` both stamp `lastProgressTime` every frame, because no arclength accrues while
  they are driving. Without that a long fall (up to `kAirmoveMaxAirTime`, 6 s) trips the stall timer
  mid-air and repaths from an airborne origin.
- `BotPhysics` reads sv_gravity, sv_airaccelerate, sv_accelerate, sv_friction, sv_stopspeed and
  sv_edgefriction, so plan-time physics match a non-default server. Only the first three were read
  before, which silently diverged the profile from the engine.
- Jump waypoints are commitments — not passed until the jump is made, and gated on on-ground,
  distance and facing tolerance, with duck added while rising.
- Aim leads the next waypoint rather than the current one, so the bot looks around corners; the move
  direction comes from the steered direction, not from where it is looking.

### RunAirmoveApproach / RunAirmoveDrive
The steering that takes over once the tracker's `wpIndex` reaches an air-move launch waypoint. It aims
`kAirmoveApproachLead` past the launch along the launch heading and commits when the bot is within one
frame of the launch plane **and is up to speed**.

The lead is `NavPlan::AirmoveLaunchLead` — `speed * frametime`, one frame of travel, shared with the
planner so both sides agree on where the bot stops accelerating. It used to carry a flat
`kAirmoveLaunchSlack` of 4 units on top, which bought nothing and cost every jump 4 units of run-up;
on `test37_walkent`, whose approach only has 19.5 units of straight, that was most of the margin.

**A launch under `kAirmoveLaunchSpeedTolerance` of its design speed is not taken.** `PmSim`,
`JumpLandsIn` and the sampler all begin their simulation *at* the design speed, so a launch delivered
short is a jump the plan never modelled. Nothing checked it, and the gap was systemic rather than
per-map — `qconsole.log` showed 222 planned against 146 delivered, repeatedly, and the launches that
matched their design speed were the ones that landed where they were aimed. `test37_walkent` crossed
the plane at 239 of 270 and fell 274 units into the pit it was jumping over.

When the bot reaches the plane still short, it penalizes the connection, requests a repath and brakes
(`RunAirmoveDrive` with drive 0 solves to full reverse thrust) instead of jumping. The bot pays one
approach to learn the edge is undeliverable, and the +5 s penalty routes the next plan around it —
the same penalize-and-repath loop a bad landing already used, moved earlier so the lesson costs an
abort rather than a fall.

Two things about the drive are easy to get wrong and both stalled real routes:

- **The command is a target velocity, not a wish speed.** `RunAirmoveDrive` puts `drive` through
  `NavFollow::SolveDrive` while on the ground, exactly as `Track` does. Passing `launchSpeed` straight to
  `pfnRunPlayerMove` looks equivalent and is not: below `sv_stopspeed` the engine's friction drop is
  constant, so a raw wish speed under `stopSpeed * friction * edgeFriction / accelerate` moves the bot
  nowhere at all. At a ledge — which is where every dropoff launches from — `sv_edgefriction` doubles
  that to 80 at defaults. A dropoff planned at 57 pressed at full drive and crawled at 2 u/s until the
  stall timer repathed it, forever. `doc/nav.md` has the derivation.
- **Ducking scales the command, so the command has to be scaled back.** `PM_Duck` multiplies
  forwardmove/sidemove by `kDuckingMultiplier` *after* `PM_CheckParamters` has clamped them, so
  delivering wish speed `W` while `FL_DUCKING` means commanding `W / kDuckingMultiplier` and accepting
  that nothing above `maxspeed * kDuckingMultiplier` is reachable. `Bot_MoveNav` did this and
  `RunAirmoveDrive` did not, so every crouched air move was driven at a third of its planned speed.

`RunAirmoveFlight` keeps commanding the raw heading — no servo — because `PM_AirAccelerate` caps its wish
speed at 30 in flight and the trajectory is already committed.

**A landing outside `airmoveTargetArea` penalizes the connection, then forces a repath.**
`RunAirmoveFlight` resolves the landed area and calls `Nav::PenalizeConnection` on the index latched at
launch, or `RewardConnection` when it landed where it was aimed (see `doc/nav.md`). Without that, a
maneuver the follower cannot execute was an unbounded loop: both repath triggers re-plan from the
bot's current position with the full graph, nothing recorded the failure, and the new start position
could flip which route was cheapest — so the bot alternated between two routes into the same dead end
and `actual=` grew as `[11,12,13,11,12,13,...]` for the whole run.

test50_stairs is the map that motivated it, and it shows why this is not a planner or a mesh bug.
Jumping up a staircase is roughly a coin flip: a clipped riser eats all forward speed and throws the
mover sideways. The plan is valid and the sim proves the arc — but the follower launches from the same
point at the same yaw and speed every time, so an edge a human clears half the time fails every time
for the bot. With the penalty disabled the run is a clean 2-cycle, conn 38 → replan → conn 35 → replan
→ conn 38, until the test times out at 12 s; with it the bot penalizes both and walks up instead,
arriving in ~2 s.

An oscillating `actual=` list therefore now means the penalty has not caught up yet — one more failure
per bad edge — or that every remaining route is bad. It no longer means "no memory".

A repath inside an air move's run-up leg makes this worse in a way worth recognising. `Repath` starts
the plan at the bot's own position and `Cross` then places the run-up node a fixed distance back along
the launch heading, so a bot that has already closed most of that distance gets a first waypoint
*behind* it and walks backwards to reach it. The plan is not wrong — it is the same plan it would
build from anywhere — but the bot arrives at the run-up node with no speed, which is the worst state
to start a launch that has to build speed at a ledge. Two waypoints at the same 2D point at the head
of the list in `crossbot_nav_status` are the tell.

### Ladders

`RunLadderApproach` walks the bot to the mount and latches `CBot::ladderActive`; `RunLadderMove` then
owns every frame until it finishes, exactly as the air move does. Four rules make the difference between
a climb and the jump-on-jump-off loop test53_ladder4 used to run.

**Never hold `IN_JUMP` while `MOVETYPE_FLY`.** `PM_LadderMove` reads the jump button before anything
else and answers with `movetype = MOVETYPE_WALK; velocity = normal * 270` — one frame of jump ejects the
bot off the ladder at 270 u/s. The reach-up hop that grabs a dangling rung is therefore gated on
`!onLadder`, not just `FL_ONGROUND`: at the foot of a ladder that reaches the floor the bot is on the
ladder *and* on the ground at once, so the ungated version hopped on, ejected, walked back and repeated
forever. `avoid.jump` is suppressed the same way, and `RunAirmoveDrive` drops the button outright when
the mover is on a ladder, so a flight that ends on one cannot bounce off it.

**Aim before driving.** `PM_LadderMove` builds its wish from the *buttons*, so `IN_MOVERIGHT` is a full
`±MAX_CLIMB_SPEED` sideways input no matter how small the `smove` that set it. A bot still turning toward
its target yaw is therefore commanding a large wrong-axis vector, and the ladder converts wrong-axis
input into the wrong motion: perp becomes pure horizontal at 200, into-the-face becomes +200 climb.
A descent that committed while still facing its run-up yaw climbed straight out of the top of the ladder
and walked off the ledge — `caught the ladder` then `fell off` 0.4 s later, 61 units sideways, twice per
run. Every on-ladder phase now zeroes `drive` while the yaw error exceeds `kLadderAimTolerance`; with no
buttons `PM_LadderMove` clears the velocity, so the bot simply hangs there and turns.

**Latch the dismount phase.** The height test that switches from climb yaw to dismount yaw sits at a
single z, so a bot hovering on it alternated targets every frame and the aim gate held `drive` at 0 for
both — a 12.7 s climb that should take 2 s. `ladderAtTop` is set once and never cleared before the next
commit.

**A climb approach aims past the mount.** `pointA` is deliberately outside the carved volume, so
steering *to* it stops the bot short of the capture region — for a ladder whose volume starts two units
beyond the stand point that is a permanent stall, jumping in place at full drive. The approach aims
`kLadderMountLead` further along `ladderYaw`, i.e. into the ladder, and lets the capture happen on the
way through.

### Elevators

`RunElevatorApproach` / `RunElevatorRide` / `FinishElevatorRide` are the ladder trio again, but the hard
part is not the driving — it is that **the ride is invisible to the profile**. The planner's boarding and
arrival waypoints are the mover's column centre at two heights (`elevators.cpp` builds both from
`centerX`/`centerY`), so they differ only in Z. `BuildPathProfile` measures `Dist2D`, gets zero, and never
pushes the segment; `ProjectOntoProfile` skips zero-length segments outright. The `gap` flag `IsGap` sets
for a ride lands on a segment that does not exist.

Three consequences, all of which had to be answered separately:

**The tracker walks through the ride.** With `projectAhead` of 64 units and both ends at the same XY, the
bot aims at the far-side corridor while standing at the near-side stop. `NavFollow::Config::sLimit` already
exists for the doubled-back activation detour, which is the same failure in weaker form, so a *pending*
ride sets the barrier too. Pending means the flag is still set: `FinishElevatorRide` clears
`requiresElevatorRide` on the bot's own copy of the waypoint rather than remembering an index, because
`SpliceDetour` rebuilds `bot.waypoints` with a shifted base and an index would not survive it. No memo is
needed the way activations need one — a repath from the far stop plans a route with no ride in it at all.

**Reprojection cannot be global.** The ladder can clear `trackState.started` when it finishes because its
two ends differ in XY. A ride's do not, so a global reprojection is free to resolve the tie in favour of
the *lower* `s` and put the bot back on the approach. `FinishElevatorRide` sets `trackState.progressS` to
the arrival waypoint's `ProfileWaypointS` by hand and leaves `started` true; the incremental window then
reaches at most `projectBack` behind, where the profile is 32 units away and cannot win the tie.

**`totalTime` under-reports by the whole ride.** The ETA integrates over segments, and there is no segment,
so `BuildPathProfile` adds `elevatorWaitTime + elevatorTravelTime` after the loop. Without it
`test55_plat`'s ETA is 3.8 s against a 4.96 s ride and `test_nav_goal.ps1` — which times out at twice the
bot's own ETA — cannot pass the map however well the bot behaves.

**The ride waypoint may own no profile segment at all**, so the approach cannot be dispatched off
`bot.waypointIndex` the way the air move and the ladder are. On `test18_elevator` the funnel corner
before the board point is the shaft centre at floor height, the board point is the same XY at the stop's
top surface, and *that* pair is zero-length too — the segment reaching the shaft carries the corner's
index and index 10 never appears in the profile. The runner is therefore driven by the barrier index the
`followCfg` loop already computed, exactly as `RunActivation` is driven by `activationWp`. Dispatching on
`waypointIndex` looked right on `test55_plat`, where the approach happens to be the ride's own segment,
and silently never boarded on test18.

Beyond that the runner is deliberately dull. It latches on `FL_ONGROUND` within `kElevatorBoardRadius`,
holds station with a `kElevatorHoldRadius` deadzone, never jumps, and aims at the waypoint *after* the
arrival one so the bot is already turned to walk off — `func_plat`'s `PLAT_DELAY` gives it three seconds.
`RunElevatorDrive` skips `SolveDrive` when drive is zero: the servo answers a residual velocity with a
full-rate reverse command, which is right on open ground and wrong on a platform edge, so friction does
the stopping instead. `lastProgressTime` is stamped every frame for the same reason the ladder stamps it,
and the 150-unit teleport reset at the top of `Bot_MoveNav` is skipped while riding, since a server hitch
would otherwise repath from mid-shaft where `FindAreaForPoint` finds nothing and the bot drops its goal.

The arrival test is `BotNavZ` against the arrival waypoint's own floor Z, directional with
`kElevatorArriveSlack`. The slack means the bot can step off up to 8 units short, and that is safe for a
reason worth stating: navgen only builds a walk seam off a stop when the step is under 18 units, so
anything within the slack is steppable by construction. On `test55_plat` the ride ends at nav 10 against
a stop at nav 18 and the bot walks out over the remainder.

The engage radius is pure XY distance to the board point, so a route that merely *passes* within 48 units
of a shaft it has not reached yet would hand the frame over early. Ordering is what protects this today:
the barrier sits at whichever comes first, so while a call button is unserviced `rideWp` is unset and the
runner is never called. On `test18_elevator` that matters concretely — the air move lands 40 units from
the board point, inside the radius, with the button still to press. If a map ever defeats that, the ride
times out, penalizes the connection and repaths; tying engagement to `progressS` reaching `sLimit` is the
tighter fix if one is needed.

`rideDeadline` is `wait + travel * kElevatorTimeMargin + kElevatorTimeGrace`; the
wait term matters because a ride *back* to the default stop does not begin until the platform's auto-return
dwell elapses. Timing out finishes the ride like any other failure — penalize the connection, repath — and
that is also what recovers a bot that walked to a boarding point whose platform someone else had ridden
away.

`bot_avoid.cpp` needed nothing: `RouteExemptsHit` already exempts every `SOLID_BSP` hit while a ride
waypoint is in the lookahead window, so the bot does not fight the platform on the way in, and the runner
returns before `BotAvoid::Update` while riding.

**What the two test maps actually cover.** `test55_plat` is the only one that exercises a sustained ride:
the bot boards the parked plat in the pit, `CPlatTrigger` fires under it, and it rides 248 units to the
ledge — the log reads `boarded ... (up)` then `ride reached the stop of after 4.18s ... area 4 (wanted 4)`
against a 4.96 s plan. Note it boards at nav −199, not the parked −230, because stepping onto the plat
starts it moving well before the bot reaches the column centre; the runner does not care, since it watches
the arrival height rather than counting from the board point. `test18_elevator` covers summon-then-board —
drop into the shaft, walk to the call button, press, board — but **not** the ride loop: the door travels
for 2.38 s while `RunActivation` holds its 2.4 s button wait, so the bot is already at the top when it
boards and the ride finishes in 0.00 s. That is correct behaviour, not a skipped test, but a map with a
call button *off* the platform is what would exercise waiting for a lift to arrive.

## bot_avoid.cpp

Reactive obstacle handling, layered between the follower's steering decision and the engine call. The
nav mesh only knows world geometry and the brush entities navgen carves, so anything else solid — a
`cycler`, a monster, another player, a door that has swung out of its own doorway — is invisible to
the planner: it routes straight through and the follower drives into it and stalls. `BotAvoid::Update`
traces forward along the planned path each frame and answers with one of three moves: crouch-jump onto
the obstacle, duck under it, or go around it.

### Which entities get avoided

**`MOVETYPE_NONE` does not identify the static ones** — this is the obvious filter and it is a no-op.
Every solid brush entity in HL is `MOVETYPE_PUSH`, `func_wall` included (`dlls/bmodels.cpp`,
`doors.cpp`, `func_break.cpp`, `plats.cpp`). The brush entities that are `MOVETYPE_NONE`
(`func_illusionary`, `CMultiSource`) are all `SOLID_NOT`, so a trace never reaches them.

`FL_WORLDBRUSH` is the flag that does identify them. `CFuncWall::Spawn` sets it — "If it can't
move/go away, it's really part of the world" — `const.h` defines it as "Not moveable/removeable brush
entity", and the HLSDK's own node graph uses it for this same test. `func_conveyor` and
`func_wall_toggle` inherit it; the only other setter is unbreakable glass. It is also precisely the
set navgen carves as blockers, so skipping it avoids fighting the mesh over geometry the mesh already
encodes.

A hit is skipped when it is worldspawn, when `solid` is none of `SOLID_BSP`/`SOLID_BBOX`/
`SOLID_SLIDEBOX`, when it is a `SOLID_BSP` with `FL_WORLDBRUSH`, or when it is the passable the route
runs through (below). Everything else is avoided, which includes other players — bot-vs-bot is not
special-cased, it simply never qualifies for either maneuver.

**The door on the route is exempt, and identifying it needs no entity id.** `RouteExemptsHit` scans
the next `kAvoidRouteLookahead` waypoints for `requiresDoor`/`requiresBreak`, resolves
`targetAreaId`, and skips the hit when the area's bounds overlap the entity's `absmin`/`absmax`. That
works because navgen builds a door/breakable area *from the entity's own brush-model bounds*: a
closed door sits inside its area and overlaps, so the bot walks into it and touches it open; an
opened door has translated out of that volume, no longer overlaps, and is avoided like anything else.
This matters because `NavAreaRecord` stores no entity or model index — a direct edict↔area link does
not exist in the format. `requiresElevatorRide` in the same window exempts every `SOLID_BSP` hit, so
the bot does not fight a plat it is about to board.

### The three maneuvers

The forward trace runs in the hull the bot currently occupies (1 standing, 3 ducked) with
`dont_ignore_monsters`, over `speed * kAvoidLookaheadTime` clamped to
`[kAvoidLookaheadMin, kAvoidLookaheadMax]`. The existing `EngineTraceFn` cannot be reused for it: it
passes `ignore_monsters` and discards `tr.pHit`. Heights are measured against the bot's feet, so
`gap = absmin.z - feetZ` and `top = absmax.z - feetZ`.

**Jump-on is tried first, because it is the faster way past** — crawling costs `kDuckingMultiplier`
of speed for the whole traverse. It applies when `top` is above step height (below that the engine
steps up for free) and within `PlainJumpHeight(gravity) + 18` less a margin. The 18 is the feet lift
from ducking in the air; the jump fires when `dist <= speed * riseTime + kAvoidJumpLead`, where
`riseTime` is the smaller root of `top - 18 = kJumpImpulse*t - g*t²/2`. At a standstill against the
obstacle that degenerates to a fixed 8-unit trigger, which still fires.

**A ducked bot cannot crouch-jump.** From a ducked stance the origin rises 45 and the feet rise with
it — there is no 18-unit credit, because the hull is already small. So when the bot is ducked and
`top` exceeds a plain jump, the latch is cleared and `suppressPlanCrouch` is set instead of jumping;
unducking is instant where there is room and the jump fires a frame or two later. On `test52_avoid`
this is also what ends the crawl under the first can row in time for the jump onto the second, which
is only 64 units further on. `kAvoidLookaheadMin` is 64 rather than smaller for the same reason: a
ducked bot moves at 83 u/s, and a speed-proportional probe alone would not see the second row until
there was no room left to stand up.

**Crawl-under** applies otherwise, when the bot is standing and `gap` clears the 36-tall duck clip
hull with margin. The hold is `(dist + depth + 2*kPlanClearance) / duckSpeed * kAvoidCrawlPenalty`:
the requested `min(x,y)/speed*penalty`, plus the remaining approach and the bot's own 32-unit depth,
evaluated at ducked speed rather than max speed. `slowApproach` caps the drive at ducked speed while
the latch is set but `FL_DUCKING` has not appeared — `PM_Duck` takes 0.4 s on the ground before the
small hull exists, which is 100 units at full speed, and on test52 the bot only has 48 from spawn to
the first row. `kAvoidDuckMinHold` is 0.5 s for the same reason: releasing `IN_DUCK` part-way through
aborts the transition.

**The hold time does not have to be accurate**, in either direction, which is why nothing maintains
it. Too short is covered by the engine — `PM_UnDuck` traces the stand hull and returns without
clearing `FL_DUCKING` when it is `startsolid`, so a bot whose latch expired under an obstacle stays
ducked and keeps crawling, and the `drive /= kDuckingMultiplier` compensation keys off `FL_DUCKING`
rather than off the latch, so its speed stays right too. Too long is covered by the jump branch,
which clears the latch when it wants to stand. An earlier design carried a second "can I stand here"
probe to maintain the latch; it was solving a problem the engine already solves.

A plan-mandated crouch always wins: avoidance may add a duck and may drop *its own* duck, but it never
overrides `requiresCrouch` or `NAV_AREA_CROUCH`.

**Going around** is the third answer, taken when neither height predicate applies — a standing player,
a full-height crate, a door that has swung open. It searches for a route past the obstacle and splices
it into the front of the plan.

### The side search

The obstacle's `absmin`/`absmax` is expanded in x and y by `kAvoidHullHalf + kAvoidCornerMargin`, so
its four corners are positions the bot's own hull can occupy with two units to spare. Projected into a
frame where *forward* is the direction from the bot to the obstacle centre and *right* is the bot's
right, two corners fall on each side. The search then walks the box perimeter: from the current point,
trace to the first corner on the chosen side, and after each corner it reaches, try to trace straight
to the destination. Up to all four corners are used, so the route can wrap around a far face.

**Two corners is not enough,** which is why the walk exists. Two suffice only when the destination is
roughly opposite the approach; when it is off to the side the leg from the far corner re-enters the
expanded box and clips the obstacle it just cleared.

**Corners are not required to be standable.** The downward hull probe at a corner supplies its z, but
when it comes back `startsolid` — the corner is buried inside a neighbouring obstacle — the corner is
kept at the previous point's height and the leg is traced to it anyway. The leg then reports the
neighbour, and *that* is the useful outcome: the search recurses on the neighbour with the **final
destination** as its target, not the unreachable corner, starting from the point the blocked trace
began. On a cluster of touching obstacles this is the only thing that works; requiring standable
corners abandons the side, and merging touching obstacles into one box over-blocks whenever the
merged rectangle spans empty diagonal quadrants.

A leg blocked by *world* geometry does not fail the side — the walk skips that corner and tries the
next. A leg blocked by an already-visited obstacle fails, which with `kAvoidMaxDepth` and
`kAvoidMaxTraces` is what terminates the recursion. The visited set is restored to its entry state
before each side is tried, so the two sides never poison each other.

**Which side first.** If the obstacle is moving, go where it is not: `dot(MoverVelocityAt, right)`
above `kAvoidMoverSpeed` picks the opposite side and takes it without evaluating the other — an
entity sliding to the bot's left sends the bot right. Otherwise both sides are evaluated and the shorter
route wins, ties going right. Right-on-tie is the useful convention for two bots meeting head-on:
their `right` vectors point opposite ways in world space, so both stepping right passes them cleanly.

**A flat hull trace has no step-up,** so a stair nosing or a slope lip reads as a wall. When a leg is
blocked by non-qualifying geometry whose plane normal is floor-like (`z >= kAvoidFloorNormal`), the
same leg is retried raised by `kAvoidStepHeight` and accepted if that clears. This is the navgen idiom
from `airmove_sampler.cpp`.

### Where the detour rejoins the plan

Not at a waypoint. navgen cannot see a `cycler` or a player, so a planned waypoint is frequently
*inside* the obstacle — no route to it exists at all, and aiming at one is how the search fails
without any geometry being to blame. Instead the remaining planned polyline is sampled forward at
`kAvoidDestStep`, and the destination is the first sample that is both outside the expanded box and
passes the ground probe. The waypoint that sample belongs to becomes `detourReplaceUntil`; waypoints
before it are dropped, since they are the ones inside the obstacle.

The detour is capped at `kAvoidDetourMaxLength` of total path. **This cap must not be relative to the
distance to the rejoin point** — the rejoin point is deliberately close, so a relative cap rejects
exactly the long routes that a cluster legitimately requires. The five-can corner on `test52_avoid`
needs 432 units to clear a rejoin point 60 units away.

### Splicing

`BotAvoid::Update` returns the points; `SpliceDetour` in `bot_move_nav.cpp` owns the surgery, because
it already has `MakePlanTraces`. The waypoint list is rebuilt as
`[bot origin] + [detour points] + [plan from detourReplaceUntil]` with the index reset to 0, then
`BuildPathProfile`, a fresh `TrackState`, and `lastProgressS`/`lastProgressTime` reset — the same
sequence `Repath` performs. Splicing rather than running a second follower means the detour gets the
arc profile, the speed solve, the stall detector and the status dump for free.

**The list has to start at the bot's own origin.** A profile whose first segment begins at the far
corner leaves the bot over `Config::rejoinAbort` (96) lateral on frame one, and `follow.needRepath`
undoes the detour immediately. Dropping the already-traversed waypoints matters for the same reason
`Repath` does it: a from-scratch projection over a profile that still contains the route behind the
bot can snap backwards onto it.

Detour waypoints carry `BotAvoid::kDetourClearance` rather than the default 16. `BuildPathProfile`
sizes corner arcs from clearance, and a wide arc at a detour corner cuts back into the obstacle the
corner was placed to clear. `estimatedArrivalTime` is extended by the added length so the test's
ETA-derived timeout stays honest. The splice invalidates the `wp` pointer, so the frame ends with
`RunIdleMove` and a return.

### When no route exists

Treated like a failed air move: `Nav::PenalizeConnection` on the connection the bot is trying to
cross, then an immediate repath. `PlanWaypoint::connIndex` is only set on airmove launches, so the
connection is recovered from `plannedConnPath` (captured from `path.connPath` in `Repath`) at the
index where `plannedAreaPath` holds `currentAreaId`.

Airmove penalties are paired with `RewardConnection` on success and walk connections need that pairing
more, not less: the blocker may be a player who moves on a second later, and without the reward one
transient obstruction poisons a corridor for the rest of the map. `RewardEnteredConnection` fires when
`currentAreaId` advances to the next planned area over a connection that carries a penalty.
`kAvoidSearchCooldown` bounds the failure loop to one penalty per second when the map genuinely has
only one way through.

`crossbot_nav_avoid 0` disables the layer, which is how to A/B a suspected regression without
rebuilding.

### Obstacles that are leaving anyway

A `func_door_rotating` has `v.velocity == 0` — all of its motion is in `v.avelocity` — so without
help it reads as a stationary wall, gets penalised, and forces a repath over an obstacle that will
have removed itself within a second. `MoverVelocityAt` gives the linear velocity of a chosen point on
a mover, `v.velocity + omega x r`, and both the side ordering and the failure handling use it.

**`avelocity` is a rate on the angles triple `(pitch, yaw, roll)` in degrees per second, and the
mapping to world axes is not the identity.** From `AngleVectors`, `forward = (cp*cy, cp*sy, -sp)`, so
at yaw 0 a positive pitch swings `+X` toward `-Z`: pitch is rotation about **+Y**. `right` at
pitch = yaw = 0 is `(0, -cos r, -sin r)`, so roll swings `-Y` toward `-Z`: roll is about **+X**. Yaw
is about **+Z** — `avelocity (0,30,0)` is 30 degrees per second counterclockwise seen from above. So
`omega = (av.z, av.x, av.y)` in radians, and getting this wrong costs a sign, which is the whole
answer.

**`r` starts at the trace contact point, then is stretched to the model's own reach.** It cannot come
from `absmin`/`absmax`: whenever a `SOLID_BSP` entity's `angles` are non-zero, `SV_LinkEdict` throws
away the real bounds and publishes a cube of the largest half-extent found over all three axes,
centred on `v.origin`. `test9_door`'s door leaf is 18 x 66 x 98 and its box is measured at
`(318,78,-2)…(450,210,130)` — a 132-unit cube centred on its own hinge. Any radius taken from that is
meaningless, and a point on the wrong side of the hinge inverts the result.

Note the condition is `angles != 0`, not "is moving": a door that has finished opening and come to a
dead stop still sits at 90 degrees, so it keeps the cube permanently. Only a door closed in its spawn
orientation gets a tight box. That, not the swing, is why `PickDestination`'s lookahead is swamped
near an open rotating door. The contact point is a real position on the leaf, so its *direction* from the axis is right —
but its *distance* is whatever the probe happened to graze, and a probe that clips the leaf near the
hinge reports a few units per second for a door doing 100 degrees per second. Scaling `r` out to
`sqrt(max|mins.x|,|maxs.x|)^2 + (max|mins.y|,|maxs.y|)^2)` treats the leaf as the bar it is. The
magnitude can only be overestimated, and the sign — the thing being decided — never changes.

**The direction to dot against is the next waypoint, not `pathDir`.** `pathDir` is the follower's aim
point, which leads the bot around corner arcs and can already be pointing at the far side of a turn
while the bot still needs to travel the near leg. On `test9_door` the aim was `(0.16,0.99)` — north,
around the corner — while the door was sweeping `(+112,-24)` east out of the corridor the bot was
about to walk down. Dotting against the aim gave `-6` and the door was called a wall; dotting against
the next waypoint gives `+102` and it is correctly called receding.

Above `kAvoidMoverSpeed` a failed search sets `AVOID_FOLLOW` instead of `AVOID_BLOCKED`, and
`bot_move_nav.cpp` skips **both** the connection penalty and the forced repath, so the bot keeps
driving at its current waypoint and walks after the door. Three things bound that: the door reaches
its stop and `avelocity` goes to zero, at which point the next search penalises normally;
`kAvoidSearchCooldown` re-takes the verdict at most once a second; and the 2 s `kRepathInterval`
stall detector is the outer net if the classification is ever wrong. A stationary obstacle scores
exactly zero and keeps the old behaviour, which is what the `closing` field in the decision line is
for.

## bot_manager.cpp

### PrintNavStatus
Backs `crossbot_nav_status`, and is the only view of what the runtime planner actually decided —
`--dump-path` shows what navgen would plan for its own spawn/target pair, which is usually a different
pair and often the opposite direction. Prints:
- Origin, velocity, angles, move speeds
- Goal state, target waypoint
- Elapsed time vs ETA (with OVERDUE flag)
- Planned and actual area paths (truncated)
- Full waypoint list with jump/crouch flags

The pairs that carry the diagnosis:
- `vel` against `move` — `move` is the forward/side pair last handed to `pfnRunPlayerMove`. Large
  `move` with `vel=(0,0,0)` is the bot pressing at full drive and not moving: it is against geometry,
  not lost and not idle.
- `planned=` against `actual=` — planned is the route's area sequence, actual is the areas walked.
  Actual diverging once is a repath; actual cycling is the air-move loop described under
  `RunAirmoveApproach`.
- `waypoint=i/n` against the waypoint list — which maneuver it is stuck before. `n` also reveals a
  repath, since a fresh plan renumbers from the bot's position.
- `hasGoal=0` with `waypoint=0/0` is ambiguous by itself: it is both "arrived and cleared the goal"
  and "gave up". Distinguish with the distance to the goal, and remember the goal was clamped
  (see `doc/nav.md`, `PlanPath`).
- `avoid=` with `hit=` — the last obstacle decision (`duck`, `jump`, `side`, `blocked`) and the
  classname it was made against, plus `duckLeft` on the crawl latch, the `gap`/`top` the decision was
  made from, and `detour=` for how many spliced detour waypoints are still ahead. `avoid=none hit=-`
  on a bot stalled against something means the trace never qualified a hit, which is a different bug
  from a mistimed maneuver; `avoid=blocked` means it qualified and no route past it was found. Each
  new decision also prints its own line to the server console with distance, speed and trace count,
  which is what makes this tunable from one run — note those lines go to `qconsole.log`, not to the
  RCON transcript the test scripts capture.

## bot_move.h

### Bot_DecomposeMove
Splits a world-space direction into the forward/side speeds pfnRunPlayerMove takes, which the engine reads along the view axes -- so this is what lets the bot move somewhere other than where it is looking. viewYawDeg must be the yaw passed to pfnRunPlayerMove in that same call plus punchangle, because PM_CheckParamters builds the movement basis from exactly that.

PM_CheckParamters clamps the pair down to maxspeed before anything reads it, so a driveLength well over maxspeed just means "full speed exactly this way", and one below it passes through untouched and becomes the actual speed.
